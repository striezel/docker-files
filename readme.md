# Dockerfiles

This repository is not meant to provide source code for a full, usable program.
Instead it contains a collections of `Dockerfile`s to use with Docker that are
mainly created for myself, but if someone else finds them useful, that is fine.

It's assumed that you know how to use Docker, so no further information is
provided. If you need more information, take a look at
<https://docs.docker.com/>, in particular the "Get started with Docker" guide.
